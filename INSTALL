To install the Vulnero website copy this folder in its
entirety to your WordPress installation's wp_content/plugins
directory and install it from the WordPress administration panel's
widget setup area.

You'll need to make sure that the Zend Framework is available
in PHP's include_path, or you can update this project's submodules
to use the included Zend Framework 1.11 with something like:

$ git submodule update --init
